## WebLab 2015 Model-View-Controller Exercise ##

This is an exercise which uses the MVC pattern to present data to a user and interact with a mySQL database. I used this to implement a very simple inventory tracking system for a friend's wood turning business.

* Driver/Controller is webroot/StockTracker.php
* Requires bootstrap.min.css in webroot/css
